this began as an extension of:

### toronto_neighbourhoods
Chloropleths of Toronto Neighbourhood populations using R

Data from Toronto Open data: http://www.toronto.ca/open

### choroplethrAdmin1

this package looked promising, but did not allow the import of one's own shape files.

#### thus began

an odyssey to deconstruct the secrective proprietary format and add new shapes
